Recipe to push test->production (bots>=3.0)
-------------------------------------------

Recipe to use a standard `directory comparison
tool <UsefulTools#Compare_and_merge.md>`__ to manage the differences in
configuration between test and production: 1. For both environments,
make configuration index file (menu->Systasks->Make configuration index)
1. Compare both environments using a `directory comparison
tool <UsefulTools#Compare_and_merge.md>`__. What you should compare is:
\* All files in *bots/usersys*. \* Note that the file
*bots/usersys/index.py* contains the configuration as in the database
(routes, channels, partners). 1. Push changes using such this tool. 1.
And read configuration index file (menu->Systasks->Read configuration
index) to the database.

if the configuration index file is generated all configuration is in
usersys (routes, mappings, partners etc).

By using the 'isolated acceptance test' both environments can be 'very
equal'.

The configuration index file can also be generated by command line tool.

Look like it is possible to use a version control system. I have not
tried it, but recipes and experiences are welcome!
