Using partner groups
--------------------

edi-partners can be assigned to groups.

This might come in handy:

.. raw:: html

   <ul><li>

partner dependent translations (in
bots-monitor->Configuration->Translations). Select a group here, and
translation is done for all members of the group.

.. raw:: html

   </li><li>

partner-based filtering for routes/outchannel (in
bots-monitor->Configuration->Routes): the outchannel is used for all
members of the group.

.. raw:: html

   </li><li>

in selections you can use partner-groups. Note: partner-groups do not
work for confirmations.

.. raw:: html

   </li></ul>
