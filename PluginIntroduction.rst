What is a plugin?
-----------------

-  A plugin is a file with predefined configuration for bots. It
   includes routes, channels, grammars, mappings etc.
-  Plugins are installed via *bots-monitor-Systasks->Read plugin*.
-  In order to run the routes in a plugin you first have to activate the
   routes.
-  There are useful plugins on `the bots sourceforge
   site <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/>`__.
-  `Documentation <PluginList.md>`__ for these plugins.

Note: grammars for edifact and x12 are NOT plugins, and can not be
installed.
