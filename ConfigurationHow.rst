How do I make an edi configuration?
-----------------------------------

1. Use `plugins <PluginIntroduction.md>`__. This is a quick and easy way
   to install predefined configurations of bots.

   -  Downloads: `bots sourceforge
      site <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/>`__
   -  Description of plugins: `on this wiki page <PluginList.md>`__
   -  Plugins can be shared by users and communities. Send your plugin!

2. Use a plugin 'close' to what you want, and adapt.
3. Do your own configuration:

   -  Take a look at `the tutorial <StartMyFirstPlugin.md>`__.
   -  Use bots-monitor for configuration of routes, channels,
      translations and partners.
   -  There are grammars for all edifact and x12 messages `on the bots
      sourceforge
      site <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/grammars/>`__.
   -  Grammars and mapping require knowledge of edi and edi-standards
      and some python knowledge. (python is a relatively easy
      programming, no deep knowledge of python is needed).
   -  Use command line tool 'bots-xml2botsgrammar.py' to generate a
      grammar from an xml file.
   -  Check a grammar using the command line tool 'bots-grammar.py'.
