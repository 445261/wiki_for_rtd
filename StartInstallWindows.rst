1. Install Python

   1. Check if Python is already installed.
   2. Use python version 2.6 or 2.7; Python >= 3.0 does not work.
   3. Download Python installer from http://www.Python.org
   4. Install python (double-click).

2. Install bots

   If not: contact us via the mailing list. Note 1: mind your rights.
   Both Python and Bots need to be installed as admin (windows
   vista/7/8). Note 2: the windows installer includes all dependencies
   for standard installation. Some extra dependencies are needed for
   less used functions (eg. extracting data from excel or pdf files).
